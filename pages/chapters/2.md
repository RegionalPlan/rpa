chapter_title: "It's expensive to live here"
chapter_intro: "The tri-state region has become more attractive, and it has also become more expensive. While housing costs have risen sharply and property taxes are taking a larger share of household budgets, household incomes have stagnated. In fact, median household incomes have dropped by 4% since1990, outpacing the national average of 1%.  The region has always been expensive and crowded, and improvements in the economy and quality of life drive up prices and attract more residents and businesses. But when incomes don’t keep pace with prices, or if the hassles of living here start to outweigh the advantages, it becomes harder to attract and retain talented workers. Indeed, outmigration from the region increased during the red-hot real-estate market of the mid-2000s in spite of the strong economy. "

### Average incomes, adjusted for inflation, have dropped since 1990 for more than three-quarters of the region’s households.

### The changing economy is narrowing the path to higher-paying jobs.
Many of the industries that have seen the greatest gains in number of employees pay the lowest wages. Higher-paid jobs tend to be in industries that are declining in employment.

### Education is a strong predictor of future success. Yet we fail to provide quality public education to children in many poor and non-white communities.
Even adjusted for income, elementary school test scores are very highly correlated with upward mobility. And yet, the region offers children in poor and non-white communities access to a small fraction of the number of good schools that children living in higher-income and whiter neighborhoods have.

### And our communities are some of the most segregated in the nation.
With the share of African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians at 48% of the region’s population and growing, the New York metropolitan area will soon be “majority-minority.” And yet, segregation among different ethnicities persists. In fact, we live in one of the most segregated regions in the country.
