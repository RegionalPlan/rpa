chapter_title: 3. The rising cost of living threatens our prosperity and quality of life.
chapter_intro: "The tri-state region has become more attractive, but it has also become more expensive. While household incomes have stagnated, housing costs have risen sharply and property taxes are taking a larger share of household budgets. The discretionary income left over is often too small to cover critical expenses like health care, college, child care and food.   <p>The region has always been expensive and crowded, and improvements in the economy and quality of life drive up prices and attract more residents and businesses. But when incomes don’t keep pace with prices, or if the hassles of living here outweigh the advantages, it becomes harder to attract and retain talented workers. Indeed, the peak of real-estate market of the mid-2000s, when housing was most expensive, coincided with the peak of the migration out of the region."

### How we build our communities influences access to opportunity.
A recent study found a number of factors that are associated with places that have higher rates of upward mobility. Several of these can be influenced by land use, housing and transportation policies.

Places that offer
> **shorter commute times,**
are more
> **ethnically and economically integrated,**
and have
> **better schools**
are places with
> **greater economic mobility.**

### Our world-class public transportation system gives people of all backgrounds access to millions of jobs.
Our transit system is the backbone of the region, providing residents with quick access to a large number – and range – of jobs. Someone living in New York City and parts of northern New Jersey can reach well over a million jobs within an hour by public transportation, and as many as three million jobs if they live in Manhattan. This advantage declines for those without a college degree, since a higher share of low-skill jobs are located in the suburbs.

### But our highly segregated communities hinder access to opportunity.
With the share of African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians at 48% of the region’s population and growing, the New York metropolitan area will soon be “majority-minority.” And yet, segregation among different ethnicities persists. In fact, we live in one of the most segregated regions in the country.

### Children in poor and non-white communities are far more likely to live near low-achieving schools.
Even adjusted for income, elementary school test scores are very highly correlated with upward mobility. And yet, the region offers children in poor and non-white communities access to a small fraction of the number of good schools that children living in higher-income and whiter neighborhoods have.

### The changing economy is narrowing the path to higher-paying jobs.
Many of the industries that have seen the greatest gains in number of employees pay the lowest wages. Higher-paid jobs tend to be in industries that are declining in employment.

### … a trend exacerbated by skyrocketing housing costs.
Today, nearly four in 10 households spend more than 35% of their income on housing, up from less than three in 10 in 1990. An increase in the cost of housing is a national trend, but it is more pronounced in this region. These costs are cushioned by relatively low transportation costs, thanks to our excellent public-transit system, but combined housing and transportation costs still account for almost half of household budgets.

### The lion’s share of income goes to housing, transportation and taxes, leaving little for other important expenses.
Discretionary income is the amount left over after local and state income taxes, property taxes and transportation and housing expenses, have been subtracted from median household income. The amount available to the average household for food, medical expenses, child care, education and other expenses ranges from $17,000 per year in the Bronx to $39,000 in Somerset County, N.J.

Counties with the highest average incomes also have the highest amounts of discretionary income. As expected, income taxes are highest where incomes are greatest. Transportation costs are highest where transit use is lowest. Housing costs, in dollar terms, were generally highest where incomes were highest, but with more variation.

### The region places an excessive reliance on property taxes to fund government services.
The extent of government services – especially education – funded by local property taxes is greater than in many other parts of the country. This contributes to property taxes in suburban counties such as Nassau and Westchester to be among the highest in the nation. Rising health care costs for both active and retired employees and high pension costs also put pressure on local property tax levies. In areas where property values are relatively low, the high property tax rate as a percentage of property value has the effect of deterring the entry of new businesses.

> _Affordability is one of the biggest concerns for the region’s residents.
‘We never feel like we have enough money to put down on a house. I feel like we never get ahead, we’re just always kind of just keeping our heads above water. And it’s sad because you feel like you want to give your child more, rather than just moving from rental to rental.’
-- Deborah, Fairfield County, Conn._

### The high cost of living here also makes it more costly to do business.
Everything from labor to taxes to office space costs more here than in most regions. This is typical for metropolitan areas with high-value industries and high education levels, but the expense can make it particularly difficult to retain middle-income jobs and support entrepreneurs.
