chapter_title: "Our government institutions are failing to make the hard decisions the region needs. "
chapter_intro: "Metropolitan regions around the world are demonstrating that is possible to broaden prosperity by investing in new business centers and communities; build modern infrastructure that expands capacity, improves resilience and boosts economic competitiveness; and adopt innovative solutions to protect coastal areas. <p><p> But for a variety of reasons, we fail to address our most persistent problems of affordability, opportunity and resilience. We haven’t been able to amend land-use and building regulations to facilitate the construction of more housing and encourage the development of communities that accommodate a range of families, especially in the suburbs. We haven’t streamlined procurement practices enough to reduce costs. We haven’t found a way to share public services among districts to increase efficiencies without reducing local control. We haven’t modified tax structures to promote a more productive and diversified economy. We haven’t built new public transportation to help people get to more jobs and schools in less time. And we haven’t invested in the technological and physical infrastructure systems that would help make our society and economy more resilient when disaster strikes. "
