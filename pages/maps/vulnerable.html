source: "Note: This flood layer is used to analyze populations that may be vulnerable to flooding in the RPA region in the future by looking at the current 100-year floodplain and sea-level rise (SLR) predictions.  Three areas were combined for coastal flooding accounting for sea level rise by 2050- highest scenarios provided by NOAA and TNC. Additionally, the 100-year ABFE floodplain by FEMA is used to account for riverine flooding.  <br> Coastal Flooding For NJ + NY State (excluding NYC): Sea Level Rise Planning Tool - New Jersey and New York State, 2050 Data NOAA, in partnership with FEMA, USACE, USGCRP, and CEQ has created a set of data, map services, and related tools to help communities, residents, and other stakeholders consider risks from future sea level rise in planning for reconstruction following Hurricane Sandy. Even if current storm patterns remain the same in the future, sea level rise will increase the impact of coastal flooding during storms. We have resources that help us quantify current risk, such as FEMA�s Best Available Flood Hazard Data* for affected areas of New York and New Jersey, but these do not provide information on future risks.  The data provided here integrates FEMA's best available special flood hazard area (SFHA) with the highest scenario of sea level rise. This scenario provides estimates of global sea level rise by the year 2050 based on the best available science synthesized by a panel of scientists from multiple federal agencies and academic institutions to provide to the U.S. National Climate Assessment*. A detailed explanation of the scenarios is published in an interagency report titled �Global Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States National Climate Assessment� (Parris et al, 2012)*.  <br> For NYC: Sea Level Rise Planning Tool - New York City, 2050 Data Created by NOAA- These New York City maps, the map services integrate FEMA's best available (SFHA) with regional scenarios of sea level rise developed by the New York Panel on Climate Change (NPCC). The NPCC 2013 scenarios* and are based on similar global sea level rise assumptions as the NOAA 2012 scenarios*. Collectively, this integrated set of products can help decision makers plan for the future risks posed by sea level rise remain flexible and adaptive in the face of environmental change.  We are using the highest Sea Level Rise scenario for 2050. <br> For CT: The data used is provided by The Nature Conservancy. We used their category 3 storm scenario with the higest sea level rise scenario for 2050.  <br> Riverine Flooding FEMA's ABFE 100-year floodplain. <br> Sources: FEMA's Best Available Flood Hazard DAta; FEMA's ABFE 100-Year Floodplain; NPC 2013 scenarios; NOAA 2012 scenarios; U.S. National Climate Assessment; Global Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States National Climate Assessment (Parris et al, 2012)"
