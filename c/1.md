chapter_title: "The tri-state region has made enormous strides. "
chapter_intro: "After the deep recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s, the tri-state region has bounced back. People are choosing to live here and the economy is flourishing. New York City is now one of the safest big cities in the nation. Public health has improved, as has quality of life.  A number of global trends have fueled this renaissance, from economic changes that favor places with large concentrations of highly educated workers to demographic changes that make walkable, transit-oriented communities more desirable. Intentional policy choices, some made decades ago, have allowed the region to capitalize on these trends and lead an international urban revival."

### The region has gained 2.6 million residents since 1990…

After decades of decline, the region’s relative share of the nation’s population appears to be stabilizing.

### … and more than 1.5 million jobs.

The region’s share of national employment also has stabilized since the 1990s.

### Life expectancy has grown much faster than the national average.

In a striking reversal, residents in our region now live longer than the national average. Local public health initiatives and environmental improvements, sharp declines in homicides and HIV-related deaths and national improvements in health care, including declines in smoking, all have played a significant role.

### Crime has dropped dramatically in all parts of the region – especially in New York City and other urban areas.
Continuing a trend that began in 1991, New York City’s crime rate dropped by 35% and Northern New Jersey’s by 26% between 2000 and 2011. Crime also declined in other parts of the region at rates similar to the nationwide drop of 20%.

### Transit ridership is higher than it has been in decades.
Every year, more than four billion trips – or 184 per person – are taken on buses, subways, commuter railroads and ferries, and that number is increasing fast. No other U.S. metropolitan area comes close.

### Businesses near transit reach far more workers of all skill and education levels.
Businesses in Midtown or Downtown Manhattan have access to well over two million workers who can reach them by bus, subway or commuter train in less than an hour. Parts of Brooklyn, Queens and Hudson County, N.J., each have access to more than a million workers, with an advantage in reaching both those with college degrees and those with less education. Many businesses in the suburbs that are within walking distance of a commuter rail station can access more than half a million workers, significantly expanding their choice of potential employees.
