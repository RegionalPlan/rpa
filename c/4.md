chapter_title: The suburbs are falling behind.
chapter_intro: "In the second half of the 20th century, our suburbs grew quickly as residents abandoned cities. In the last 20 years, that pattern has been upended. People and jobs are moving into New York, Jersey City, White Plains, Stamford and other urban communities. Construction in these cities has surged, driven both by demand and by municipal policies. And while poverty rates are still far higher in the cities, they are growing much faster in the suburbs.  The suburban slide threatens the region’s prosperity as a whole. New York and the region’s other cities depend on the suburbs for a large share of their workforce, and the metropolitan area’s appeal depends in part on having a diverse mix of urban and suburban communities. Without more suburban housing priced for different income levels, cities will bear a heavy burden of meeting the region’s affordable-housing needs.  "

### The demand for urban, walkable communities is on the rise …
Of the region’s residents who wish to move out of their current neighborhood,
**in 1995 only 13% wanted to move to an urban community. Today, twice as many people**
(26%) are inclined to make that choice. This change is being driven by young adults: Nearly half (45%) of 18-29 years olds who want to move would prefer living in an urban area.

### The rate of housing construction in New York City is overtaking the suburbs.
For decades, the largest share of housing construction took place in the suburbs. The tide began to turn in the mid-1990s due to a combination of high demand in New York City, pro-development policies in New York and other cities, and restrictive zoning in many suburban communities.
