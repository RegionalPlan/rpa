      New York has always been hailed as a region of opportunity, built by millions of immigrants and their descendants who worked hard to climb the economic ladder. Today still, the breadth of job, career and business possibilities available here attracts everyone from the unskilled to successful professionals and entrepreneurs.   A person born into poverty has a better chance becoming an affluent adult here than in many other U.S. metropolitan areas. But it’s still a long shot – just one in 10 people born in the poorest 20% of families reached the top 20% as adults (compared with one in 12 nationally). For many of the region’s residents, particularly those growing up in poor, African-American, Hispanic and Asian neighborhoods, the chances of climbing the economic ladder are slim.

        <h3>How we build our communities influences access to opportunity.</h3>

<p>A recent study found a number of factors that are associated with places that have higher rates of upward mobility. Several of these can be influenced by land use, housing and transportation policies.</p>

<p>Places that offer
<strong>shorter commute times,</strong>
are more
<strong>ethnically and economically integrated,</strong>
and have
<strong>better schools</strong>
are places with
<strong>greater economic mobility.</strong></p>

<h3>Our world-class public transportation system gives people of all backgrounds access to millions of jobs.</h3>

<p>Our transit system is the backbone of the region, providing residents with quick access to a large number – and range – of jobs. Someone living in New York City and parts of northern New Jersey can reach well over a million jobs within an hour by public transportation, and as many as three million jobs if they live in Manhattan. This advantage declines for those without a college degree, since a higher share of low-skill jobs are located in the suburbs.</p>

<h3>But our highly segregated communities hinder access to opportunity.</h3>

<p>With the share of African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians at 48% of the region’s population and growing, the New York metropolitan area will soon be “majority-minority.” And yet, segregation among different ethnicities persists. In fact, we live in one of the most segregated regions in the country.

<h3>Children in poor and non-white communities are far more likely to live near low-achieving schools.</h3>

<p>Even adjusted for income, elementary school test scores are very highly correlated with upward mobility. And yet, the region offers children in poor and non-white communities access to a small fraction of the number of good schools that children living in higher-income and whiter neighborhoods have.

<h3>The changing economy is narrowing the path to higher-paying jobs.</h3>

<p>Many of the industries that have seen the greatest gains in number of employees pay the lowest wages. Higher-paid jobs tend to be in industries that are declining in employment.
