  <div class="intro">
    <div class="container">
      The tri-state region has become more attractive, but it has also become more expensive. While housing costs have risen sharply and property taxes are taking a larger share of household budgets, household incomes have stagnated. In fact, median household incomes have dropped by 4% since1990 – a much steeper decline than the national average of 1%.  Of course, the region has always been high-cost and crowded, and improvements in the economy and quality of life drive up prices and attract more residents and businesses. But if incomes do not keep pace with prices, or if the hassles of living here outweigh the advantages, the region’s virtuous cycle of growth and prosperity could be interrupted.

        <h3>Affordability is one of the biggest concerns for the region’s residents.</h3>

<p>“We never feel like we have enough money to put down on a house. I feel like we never get ahead, we’re just always kind of just keeping our heads above water. And it’s sad because you feel like you want to give your child more, rather than just moving from rental to rental.”
-- Deborah, Fairfield County, CT</p>

<h3>For the lower half of the region’s households, the average income has dropped by 14% since 1990.</h3>

<p><img src="/rpa//images/ch2/graph-1.jpg" alt="Graphic"></p>

<h3>Housing costs have gone up significantly since 1990. Today, nearly four in 10 households spend more than 35% of their income on housing, up from less than three in 10 in 1990.</h3>

<h3>The lion’s share of income goes to housing, transportation and taxes, leaving little for other important expenses.</h3>

<p>//Discretionary Map//
Discretionary income, as mapped above, is the amount left over after federal, state and local income taxes, transportation expenses and housing expenses, including property taxes, have been subtracted from median household income. The amount available to the average household for food, medical expenses, child care, education and other expenses ranges from $17,000 per year in the Bronx to $39,000 in Somerset County.
Counties with the highest average incomes also have the highest amounts of discretionary income. As expected, income taxes are highest where incomes are greatest. Transportation costs are highest where transit use is lowest. Housing costs, in dollar terms, were generally highest where incomes were highest, but with more variation.</p>
